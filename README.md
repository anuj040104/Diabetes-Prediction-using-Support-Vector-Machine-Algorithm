# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Support-Vector-Machine-Algorithm

In this I have taken PMIA Diabetes Dataset as my basis. SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm 
is used for the process of classification between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

I have also used Standard Scaler library so as to make all my data come in a fixed range.

I have also calculated the accuracy of both the training and test model.

Lastly I have also manually checked the correctness of the model by passing the data of a random 
row in the model to check its output.
